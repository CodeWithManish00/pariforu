          "Today, I’m going to tell you the whole story of our love, from A to Z 🥺♥... So, we met around the same time last year, maybe a few months ago, at Sunil Bhaiya’s coaching class. We saw each other for the first time and made eye contact. You know, when I first saw you, I felt something different, but I couldn’t talk to you because I was nervous. A few days later, Bhaiya sent both of us to the upstairs room for vocab, and even then, I thought of talking to you, but I didn’t have the courage. Then, after a while, you said "Hey," and when I heard that, I can’t explain how I felt—it gave me so much peace. Something was happening inside me. After that, we talked for a while. 💫🫶🏼💖

And you know, I was about to ask you to be my friend, but just then, someone from your family came to pick you up, and that was the last time we talked. The next day, when I came to coaching, I ignored you and went straight to the upstairs room. I don’t know why I ignored you, but I did. Then, a few days later, you completely disappeared, and I thought I would forget you. But after that day, when we talked, I couldn’t forget you. I started asking Bhaiya and everyone about you, and Shubham told me you had left coaching, which hurt me. Honestly, after hearing that, I didn’t feel like going to coaching anymore. 🍀💫🧿💞🌍

Days went by, and then one day, Shubham gave me your Instagram ID. As soon as I saw it, I felt so calm, and I messaged you right away when I got home. But I didn’t get any reply. More than a month passed, and then I started sending you messages every day for about 5-6 months.👀🥺🫂💞🫶🏼🌍

Then, on February 29, 2024, it was your birthday, and I wished you. That was the first time you replied, and when I saw it, I was so happy I can’t even explain it. I was so excited that I even threw a little party to celebrate you replying. That day, I was so happy that I even made a mistake while writing in English out of excitement. After that, we talked again, and you told me you use Snapchat. I didn’t use it, but for you, I created an account with a girl’s name and started using it. We talked there for 1-2 days, and then I told you how I felt about you. You said, "No, Manish, we’re good as friends." At that time, I replied that I didn’t want just friendship. You then asked me about my future, and we talked a lot. But you never directly said yes. I could feel you had mutual feelings, but we kept talking. And now, look at us. ♥🥺🫀🫂🧿💖
